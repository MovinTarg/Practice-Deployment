This should be simple and sweet! We now have the knowledge of how to deploy an ASP.NET Core app to Azure, so we should put this knowledge to use. For this assignment pick any one of your past ASP projects(Dojodachi is a solid choice for this) and deploy it to your very own azure web server. Once complete, simply upload a text file containing the ip of your deployment server. Note do not worry about keep this instance live for too long due to the pricing of Azure!
